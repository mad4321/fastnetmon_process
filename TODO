grouping attacks

1) store attack in db
      - dst ip
      - dst ip network (/24) zero last octet
      - attack type (greflood, udpflood_port, tcpsynflood_port,...)
      - flowspec rule
      - datetime

2) if more than three (3) same attacks in same network
   then generate summary network flowspec rule (replace ip with network)

3) continue to store per ip attacks with same type

4) when receive unban message
   remove rules from this ip from db and remove flowspec from bgp

5) check for every summary network attack
   if count of specific host attack with same type is zero,
   then remove summary network flowspec rule


New Idea
------------
1) create rule for /24
2) store id db dst_ip, flow rule

3) when unban ip
get and remove rules from db for this ip
foreach rule for this ip
    if count of same rules == 0
    then unban rule


1),2),3) DONE
